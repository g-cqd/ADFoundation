/// A bounded pool of dedicated OS threads that run BLOCKING work off Swift's cooperative thread
/// pool, bridging each result back to `async`.
///
/// ## Why this exists
/// Some library calls are synchronous AND blocking — they park the calling thread (a B-tree walk
/// that faults `mmap` pages, a `read(2)`, a `writeSync`). Running one directly from an `async`
/// context blocks a cooperative-pool thread, and that pool has only ~`processorCount` threads, so
/// a handful of concurrent blocking calls can starve every UNRELATED task in the process — a
/// forward-progress violation. This pool moves each blocking call onto one of `width` dedicated
/// threads it owns, so the cooperative pool keeps running.
///
/// ## Correctness
/// The wakeup is a counting `DispatchSemaphore` signalled exactly once per enqueue and waited
/// exactly once per popped job — one-to-one accounting that is **lost-wakeup-free** regardless of
/// enqueue/drain interleaving (the mistake a hand-rolled condition variable invites). `shutdown()`
/// **joins** every worker (each signals an exit semaphore) before returning, so the owner can
/// release the pool with no thread still touching it. The `run` queue is bounded (`maxDepth`), so a
/// producer faster than the pool drains cannot grow memory without limit.
///
/// ## Use
/// `await pool.run { blockingCall() }` runs the closure on a pool thread and suspends the caller
/// until it returns (or throws). Cancelling the awaiting task BEFORE its job starts removes the job
/// and throws `CancellationError` — a job already running cannot be interrupted, the blocking call
/// must finish. The pool also conforms to `TaskExecutor`, so
/// `await withTaskExecutorPreference(pool) { blockingCall() }` is an alternative that keeps the
/// `width` concurrency bound while integrating natively with structured-concurrency cancellation.
///
/// Generalizes the single-thread `ADDBCore.WriterThread` (same 1:1-semaphore + real-join
/// discipline) to `width` threads, so an async database façade can offload its blocking reads
/// without hand-rolling — and getting wrong — a thread pool. The owner MUST call `shutdown()`
/// (e.g. from its `close()` / `deinit`): the worker threads keep the pool alive until then.
