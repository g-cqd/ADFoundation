# ``ADTestKit``

The shared testing architecture for the g-cqd AD-family — deterministic time and
async coordination on one side, property / fuzz / oracle tooling on the other.

## Overview

Every package in the AD-family (ADFoundation, ADJSON, ADSQL, ADDB, URLBuilder,
apple-docs) needs the same hard things from its test suite: time it can pin, async
work it can settle without racing, random corpora it can reproduce byte-for-byte, and
crash-injection that proves "this never traps." Before ADTestKit those tools were
re-rolled — seven copies of a SplitMix64 generator, two hand-rolled manual clocks, a
handful of subtly different temp-directory helpers. ADTestKit distils them into one
audited implementation so a bug fixed once stays fixed everywhere.

The kit is organized as **two pillars**:

- **Async & deterministic time** — a `Clock`-conforming ``TestClock`` whose hands move
  only when a test advances them, an ``AsyncEventProbe`` that suspends until *N* events
  are recorded, the `TaskProvider` seam and its settling ``TaskProviderSpy``, and two
  interleaving gates: ``ThreadGate`` (blocks a real thread) and ``AsyncGate`` (suspends
  a task).
- **Property, fuzz & oracle tooling** — a seedable ``SeededRNG`` and named ``Seed``
  registry, the ``ByteMutator`` corruption engine with the ``fuzzNeverTraps(seed:iterations:edits:mutator:traceEnv:corpus:exercise:)``
  driver, `runOnConstrainedStack` plus ``DepthSweep`` for recursion limits, the
  ``ReferenceComparison`` differential oracles, and a family of typed *fixture* asserts.

### Design principles

A few commitments run through every helper, and they show up repeatedly in the articles
below:

- **Zero real-time waiting.** Anything time-dependent is driven by an injected clock, so
  a suite of a thousand timeout tests finishes in milliseconds and never flakes on a busy
  CI box.
- **Determinism over racing.** Async work is *settled* (waited to a known boundary), not
  compared after an arbitrary delay.
- **Process survival is the assertion.** Fuzz and crash-injection helpers prove a property
  by *not aborting*; a trap is the failure, caught by the exit-test harness.
- **Never trap the runner.** Every assert routes to `Issue.record`, so one failing
  expectation reports and the suite keeps going. Only the deliberately-tested traps abort.
- **Recursion-free.** The kit's own code is iterative throughout; the only recursion lives
  in a test that deliberately overflows a constrained stack.
- **Minimal dependency surface.** `ADTestKitSeams` (the shipped-safe seams) carries no
  package dependencies; the full kit adds only swift-collections and swift-system, both
  with empty transitive graphs.

### Two products

ADTestKit ships as two libraries so production code can adopt a seam without linking a
test framework:

- **`ADTestKitSeams`** — ultra-thin, shipped-safe production seams (the `TaskProvider`
  protocol + `LiveTaskProvider`, and the `LiveClock` injection points). A library target
  links this; it pulls in nothing heavy.
- **ADTestKit** — the test-only kit (everything in the articles below). It imports the
  toolchain's Swift Testing and re-exports the seams.
