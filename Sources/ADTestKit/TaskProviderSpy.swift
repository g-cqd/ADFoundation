/// `TaskProvider` (defaulting to `LiveTaskProvider` in production) is handed this in a
/// test; instead of racing on serial-result comparison, the test triggers the work
/// and `await spy.waitForAllTasks()`.
///
/// Settling is transitive: two `AsyncEventProbe`s record each `.work` spawn and each
/// completion, and `waitForAllTasks()` loops — waiting for all-spawned-so-far to
/// complete, then re-checking whether the wait itself spawned more — until the spawn
/// count stabilizes with everything complete. `.observation` tasks (long-lived stream
/// / observation loops that never finish on their own) are excluded, so awaiting them
/// can never hang the suite. The settle deadline is clock-injectable, so it is
/// real-time-free under a `TestClock`.
