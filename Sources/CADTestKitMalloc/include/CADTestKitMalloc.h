/// tooling seam Instruments uses. It is enabled only in TEST / tooling builds and never ships in an
/// App-Store binary, so the private symbol is acceptable here. On other platforms the counter is a
/// no-op and `adtk_malloc_counting_available()` returns 0, so the Swift oracle degrades gracefully.
