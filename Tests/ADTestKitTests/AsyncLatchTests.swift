/// Coverage for the broadcast latch. The cases that matter are the ones that distinguish it from
/// ``AsyncGate`` (release-all vs release-one, idempotent open vs banked permits) plus the
/// cancellation contract shared by every parking primitive in the kit.
///
/// The waiting tests carry a `.timeLimit`: every failure mode here is "a waiter is never resumed",
/// which without a deadline is an indefinite hang rather than a diagnosable failure. Verified —
/// degrading `open()` to release a single waiter hangs the suite unless the limit is present.
